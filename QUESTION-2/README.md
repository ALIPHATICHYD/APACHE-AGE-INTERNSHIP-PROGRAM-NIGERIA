Fibonacci Piecewise Recurrence Relation Implementation in C

Development Environment:
- Operating System: Any platform that supports C compilation (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Compiler: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or any C compiler

How to Compile and Run:

1. Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad, Visual Studio Code) and paste the C code provided above into a new file named 'fibonacci.c'.

2. Save the 'fibonacci.c' file.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt.

4. Navigate to the directory where the 'fibonacci.c' file is located using the 'cd' command. For example:

    ```
    cd ~/Desktop
    ```

    cd /path/to/your/folder

5. Compile the C code using GCC or any C compiler:
    
    ```
    gcc -o fibonacci fibonacci.c
    ```

6. If there are no errors during compilation, an executable file named 'fibonacci' will be created in the same directory.

7. Run the program by typing the following command in the terminal:

    ```
    ./fibonacci
    ```

8. The program will display the output for the given arithmetic operations and fibonacci calculation.

Note: macOS comes with the Xcode Command Line Tools, which include the GCC compiler. If you don't have Xcode Command Line Tools installed, you can install them by opening Terminal and running the following command:

```
xcode-select --install
```

Once the installation is complete, you can proceed with the compilation and execution of the program.

Ensure that you have a working C compiler (GCC) installed on your macOS system to compile and run the code.
